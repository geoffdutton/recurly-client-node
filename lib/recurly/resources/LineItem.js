/**
 * LineItem
 * @typedef {Object} LineItem
 * @prop {AccountMini} account
 * @prop {string} accountingCode - Internal accounting code to help you reconcile your revenue to the correct ledger. Line items created as part of a subscription invoice will use the plan or add-on's accounting code, otherwise the value will only be present if you define an accounting code when creating the line item.
 * @prop {string} addOnCode - If the line item is a charge or credit for an add-on, this is its code.
 * @prop {string} addOnId - If the line item is a charge or credit for an add-on this is its ID.
 * @prop {number} amount - `(quantity * unit_amount) - (discount + tax)`
 * @prop {datetime} createdAt - When the line item was created.
 * @prop {number} creditApplied - The amount of credit from this line item that was applied to the invoice.
 * @prop {string} currency - 3-letter ISO 4217 currency code.
 * @prop {string} description - Description that appears on the invoice. For subscription related items this will be filled in automatically.
 * @prop {number} discount - The discount applied to the line item.
 * @prop {datetime} endDate - If this date is provided, it indicates the end of a time range.
 * @prop {string} id - Line item ID
 * @prop {string} invoiceId - Once the line item has been invoiced this will be the invoice's ID.
 * @prop {string} invoiceNumber - Once the line item has been invoiced this will be the invoice's number. If VAT taxation and the Country Invoice Sequencing feature are enabled, invoices will have country-specific invoice numbers for invoices billed to EU countries (ex: FR1001). Non-EU invoices will continue to use the site-level invoice number sequence.
 * @prop {string} origin - A credit created from an original charge will have the value of the charge's origin.
 * @prop {string} originalLineItemId - The line item where the credit originated. Will only have a value if the line item is a credit created from a previous credit, or if the credit was created from a charge refund. For some older invoices this may reference a carryforward charge.
 * @prop {string} originalLineItemInvoiceId - The invoice where the credit originated. Will only have a value if the line item is a credit created from a previous credit, or if the credit was created from a charge refund.
 * @prop {string} planCode - If the line item is a charge or credit for a plan or add-on, this is the plan's code.
 * @prop {string} planId - If the line item is a charge or credit for a plan or add-on, this is the plan's ID.
 * @prop {string} previousLineItemId - Will only have a value if the line item is a credit created from a previous credit, or if the credit was created from a charge refund.
 * @prop {string} productCode - For plan related line items this will be the plan's code, for add-on related line items it will be the add-on's code.
 * @prop {number} quantity - This number will be multiplied by the unit amount to compute the subtotal before any discounts or taxes.
 * @prop {boolean} refund - Refund?
 * @prop {number} refundedQuantity - For refund charges, the quantity being refunded. For non-refund charges, the total quantity refunded (possibly over multiple refunds).
 * @prop {ShippingAddress} shippingAddress
 * @prop {datetime} startDate - If an end date is present, this is value indicates the beginning of a billing time range. If no end date is present it indicates billing for a specific date.
 * @prop {string} state - Pending line items are charges or credits on an account that have not been applied to an invoice yet. Invoiced line items will always have an `invoice_id` value.
 * @prop {string} subscriptionId - If the line item is a charge or credit for a subscription, this is its ID.
 * @prop {number} subtotal - `quantity * unit_amount`
 * @prop {number} tax - The tax amount for the line item.
 * @prop {string} taxCode - Used by Avalara, Vertex, and Recurly’s EU VAT tax feature. The tax code values are specific to each tax system. If you are using Recurly’s EU VAT feature `P0000000` is `physical`, `D0000000` is `digital`, and an empty string is `unknown`.
 * @prop {boolean} taxExempt - `true` exempts tax on charges, `false` applies tax on charges. If not defined, then defaults to the Plan and Site settings. This attribute does not work for credits (negative line items). Credits are always applied post-tax. Pre-tax discounts should use the Coupons feature.
 * @prop {boolean} taxable - `true` if the line item is taxable, `false` if it is not.
 * @prop {string} type - Charges are positive line items that debit the account. Credits are negative line items that credit the account.
 * @prop {number} unitAmount - Positive amount for a charge, negative amount for a credit.
 * @prop {datetime} updatedAt - When the line item was last changed.
 * @prop {string} uuid - The UUID is useful for matching data with the CSV exports and building URLs into Recurly's UI.
